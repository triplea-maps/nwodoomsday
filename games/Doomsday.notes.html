This is <br>   considered legal. <br> ->Manually flying over Neutral territory during combat movement is technically possible, <br>   but considered illegal. <br> ->Under the new phase order, one knows his air losses from AA fly-overs during <br>   combat movement before his purchase. <br> ->Read the clarified bunker rules! <br> ->Under the new phase order, Germany could spend captured money from a COMPLETELY <br>   empty Paris, taken in combat move, right away in the purchase phaase <br> ->Completely empty neutrals can be taken by planes during combat movement. This is <br>   considered legal. <br> ->Manually flying over Neutral territory during combat movement is technically possible, <br>   but considered illegal. <br> <br> ->Strategical hints: (for Beginners) <br>   UK ftrs on french carriers get awesome range. <br>   Paris can be made to fall in Germany2 ( less then 1% total chance of failure) Expensive though! <br>   Russia benefits a lot of mobile, agressive units. Aggressive play recommended. <br>   Western allies can successfully invade through Spain, Scandinavia or italy itself. <br>   Italy can take Tunis, Morroco and Greece by Italy2 <br>  <br>============About This Version 1.6.1 EB (traditional phase order)===========  <br>  <br> This version implements ideas from various veteran players  <br> in an attempt to bring the version-plagued NWO community  <br> back together. It should work without additional rules or  <br> restrictions.  <br>  <br> However: if played with a STRONG axis player and an allied <br> player hating G2 Paris, it might be a good idea to use EDIT <br> to add an additional T-boat for the UK in sz29. <br> This makes G2 Paris even more expensive, rendering it unattractive. <br> if the UK T-boat is added to sz29, add a German T-boat to sz25 too! <br>  <br> The EDIT function can be found in the upper TripleA menu. Its  <br> use is straight-forward and intuitive.  <br>  <br> In NWO, balance and replay value come first, THEN historical  <br> acccuracy!  <br>  <br> Enjoy!

Some exploits pointed out. <br> -> Erroneous east/west territory names corrected <br> -> Unit names changed: <br>       Trucks        -->   Mot.Inf <br>       Halftracks    -->   Mech.Inf <br>       Scouts        -->   Tankettes <br>       German Armour -->   Panzers <br> -> XML file cleaned up <br> <br> <br> Changes compared to popular version 1.4:  <br> -> Tankette price upped from 3 to 3.5 (2 for 7PU)  <br> -> Me262 price lowered to 12  <br> -> Mot.Inf defense upped from 2 to 3  <br> -> BigArmor defense from 3 to 4, price from 7 to 8  <br> -> Cruisers transport 1 small unit now.
